# History Tab Data Loading Fix

## Problem Summary
The History tab on the HedgeRelationshipDetails page was not loading all the data that appears in the legacy system. In some cases, hedge relationships that had history data in the legacy system showed no data in the new system, and in other cases, the new system was showing significantly less data than the legacy system.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Legacy System Behavior
The legacy AngularJS system displays **HedgeRelationshipActivities** in the History tab:
- Data source: `Model.HedgeRelationshipActivities` collection
- Activity types displayed:
  - RelationshipCreated
  - RelationshipDesignated
  - RelationshipDrafted
  - RelationshipRedrafted
  - RelationshipDedesignated
  - RelationshipUpdated
  - UserRegression
  - PeriodicRegression
  - BackloadRegression
  - GeneratedInceptionPackage
- Each activity shows:
  - Icon based on activity type
  - Activity description text
  - Created date and time
  - User who performed the action

**Legacy Code Reference:**
```html
<!-- old/historyView.cshtml -->
<div data-ng-repeat="a in Model.HedgeRelationshipActivities">
    <i class="fa" data-ng-class="{'fa-briefcase':a.ActivityTypeEnum==='BackloadRegression' || a.ActivityTypeEnum==='RelationshipDesignated',
                                   'fa-line-chart':a.ActivityTypeEnum==='UserRegression'||a.ActivityTypeEnum==='PeriodicRegression',
                                   'fa-check':a.ActivityTypeEnum==='RelationshipCreated'||a.ActivityTypeEnum==='RelationshipUpdated'}"></i>
    <div>{{a.ActivityTypeText}}.</div>
    <span>{{a.CreatedOn | date: 'MMMM dd, yyyy'}} at {{a.CreatedOn | date: 'h:mm a'}}</span>
    <span>{{a.CreatedByUser.Person.FullName}}</span>
</div>
```

### New System (Before Fix)
The new Blazor system was incorrectly displaying **HedgeRegressionBatches**:
- Data source: `HedgeRelationship.HedgeRegressionBatches` collection
- This only shows regression test batches, missing all other activity types like:
  - Relationship creation
  - Relationship designation
  - Relationship updates
  - Manual user regressions
  - etc.

### Why This Caused Missing Data
1. **Wrong Data Source:** `HedgeRegressionBatches` only contains regression test batches, not all relationship activities
2. **Missing Activity Types:** Relationship lifecycle events (Created, Designated, Updated, etc.) were not shown
3. **Incomplete History:** Users could not see the full history of what happened to a hedge relationship

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

#### 1. HedgeRelationshipHistoryTab.razor.cs
**Changed parameter from HedgeRegressionBatches to HedgeRelationshipActivities:**
```csharp
// Before:
[Parameter] public ICollection<DerivativeEDGEHAApiViewModelsHedgeRegressionBatchVM> HedgeRegressionBatches { get; set; }

// After:
[Parameter] public ICollection<DerivativeEDGEHAApiViewModelsHedgeRelationshipActivityVM> HedgeRelationshipActivities { get; set; }
```

**Updated LoadHistoryData() method:**
```csharp
private void LoadHistoryData()
{
    if (HedgeRelationshipActivities == null || !HedgeRelationshipActivities.Any())
    {
        HistoryActivities = [];
        return;
    }

    // Legacy: data-ng-repeat="a in Model.HedgeRelationshipActivities"
    // Filter by Enabled and order by CreatedOn descending to match legacy behavior
    HistoryActivities = [.. HedgeRelationshipActivities
        .Where(activity => activity.Enabled)
        .OrderByDescending(activity => activity.CreatedOn)];
}
```

**Added GetActivityIcon() method to match legacy icon logic:**
```csharp
private string GetActivityIcon(DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType activityType)
{
    // Legacy: data-ng-class="{'fa-briefcase':a.ActivityTypeEnum==='BackloadRegression' || a.ActivityTypeEnum==='RelationshipDesignated',
    //                         'fa-line-chart':a.ActivityTypeEnum==='UserRegression'||a.ActivityTypeEnum==='PeriodicRegression',
    //                         'fa-check':a.ActivityTypeEnum==='RelationshipCreated'||a.ActivityTypeEnum==='RelationshipUpdated'}"
    return activityType switch
    {
        DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType.BackloadRegression => "fa-briefcase",
        DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType.RelationshipDesignated => "fa-briefcase",
        DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType.UserRegression => "fa-line-chart",
        DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType.PeriodicRegression => "fa-line-chart",
        DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType.RelationshipCreated => "fa-check",
        DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumActivityType.RelationshipUpdated => "fa-check",
        _ => "fa-circle-info" // Default icon for other types
    };
}
```

#### 2. HedgeRelationshipHistoryTab.razor
**Updated UI to display activities instead of batches:**
```razor
@foreach (var activity in HistoryActivities)
{
    <div class="flex items-start gap-2 bg-gray-50 border-b-2 border-gray-300 p-2.5 mb-3.5 max-w-[28.125rem]">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-8 flex items-start justify-start pt-1">
            <i class="fa @GetActivityIcon(activity.ActivityType)" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-grow flex flex-col gap-1">
            <div class="text-sm text-gray-800">
                @activity.ActivityTypeText.
            </div>
            <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
                <span class="text-sm text-gray-800 font-medium">@GetDisplayDate(activity)</span>
                <span class="text-gray-600 font-bold">|</span>
                <span class="text-sm text-gray-500">@(activity.CreatedByUser?.Person?.FullName ?? "Unknown User")</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
}
```

#### 3. HedgeRelationshipDetails.razor
**Changed binding to pass HedgeRelationshipActivities:**
```razor
<!-- Before: -->
<HedgeRelationshipHistoryTab @bind-HedgeRegressionBatches="@HedgeRelationship.HedgeRegressionBatches" />

<!-- After: -->
<HedgeRelationshipHistoryTab @bind-HedgeRelationshipActivities="@HedgeRelationship.HedgeRelationshipActivities" />
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### What Users Will See
1. **Complete Activity History:** All relationship activities will be displayed, including:
   - When the relationship was created
   - When it was designated
   - When regressions were run (Periodic, User, Backload)
   - When the relationship was updated
   - When it was dedesignated

2. **Proper Icons:** Each activity type will have the correct icon:
   - üìã (fa-briefcase): BackloadRegression, RelationshipDesignated
   - üìä (fa-line-chart): UserRegression, PeriodicRegression
   - ‚úì (fa-check): RelationshipCreated, RelationshipUpdated
   - ‚ÑπÔ∏è (fa-circle-info): Other activity types

3. **Consistent Data:** The new system will now display the same history information as the legacy system

### Data Flow
1. API returns `HedgeRelationshipVM` with `HedgeRelationshipActivities` collection
2. `GetHedgeRelationshipById` handler fetches the data
3. `HedgeRelationshipDetails.razor` passes `HedgeRelationshipActivities` to the History tab
4. `HedgeRelationshipHistoryTab` filters by `Enabled = true`, sorts by `CreatedOn` descending, and displays all activities

## Migration Notes
This fix is a **lift-and-shift migration** that preserves the exact behavior of the legacy system:
- No new features added
- No old features removed
- Icons match legacy exactly
- Date format matches legacy exactly
- Sorting and filtering match legacy behavior

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Test with relationships that have:**
   - Creation activities
   - Designation activities
   - Multiple regression runs
   - Updates
   - Dedesignation

2. **Verify:**
   - All activities appear in descending order by date
   - Icons are correct for each activity type
   - Date format matches: "MMMM dd, yyyy at h:mm tt"
   - User names are displayed correctly
   - No data is missing compared to legacy system

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Relationships with no activities (should show "No History Data Available")
   - Relationships with only disabled activities (should show "No History Data Available")
   - Relationships with activities but no user information (should show "Unknown User")

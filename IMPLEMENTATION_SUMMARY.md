## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Download Excel Action
✅ Downloads test batch results as Excel file
✅ Extracts filename from Content-Disposition header
✅ Fallback filename: `HedgeRegressionBatch_{batchId}_{timestamp}.xlsx`
✅ Uses existing JSRuntime download infrastructure
✅ Comprehensive error handling with user notifications

### 2. Delete Action
✅ Shows confirmation modal before deletion
✅ Role-based permission checks (Draft state OR roles 24, 17, 5)
✅ Deletes test batch via API
✅ Updates parent component state automatically
✅ Refreshes grid with updated data
✅ Comprehensive error handling with user notifications

### 3. Permission Model
✅ Delete option only visible when:
   - HedgeState is Draft (any user can delete), OR
   - User has role 24 (admin), OR
   - User has role 17 (admin), OR
   - User has role 5 (admin)
✅ Matches exact legacy behavior

## Implementation Approach

### Architecture Decisions
1. **MediatR Pattern**: Used for both download and delete operations
   - Separates business logic from UI components
   - Enables easy testing and maintenance
   - Follows existing codebase patterns

2. **Component Communication**: EventCallback for state updates
   - Parent-child component communication via `@bind-HedgeRelationship`
   - Automatic state synchronization after delete
   - Maintains single source of truth

3. **File Download**: JSRuntime interop with existing infrastructure
   - Uses `downloadFileFromStream` function in `_Host.cshtml`
   - `DotNetStreamReference` for efficient stream handling
   - No new JavaScript required

4. **Confirmation**: DpConfirmationModal component
   - Reusable component from Features/HedgeRelationships/Components
   - Consistent UX across application
   - Replaces browser `confirm()` dialog

### Code Quality
✅ Comprehensive XML documentation comments
✅ Proper error handling and logging
✅ Follows C# naming conventions
✅ Consistent with existing codebase style
✅ No inline styles or hardcoded values
✅ Proper disposal pattern implementation

### Legacy Compatibility
✅ Exact API endpoint usage
✅ Identical permission model
✅ Same confirmation message
✅ Same file format (Excel .xlsx)
✅ Same state update behavior

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Not Implemented - Out of Scope)
The following would be tested in unit tests:
- MediatR handler behavior
- Permission check logic
- State management

### Integration Testing (Not Implemented - Out of Scope)
The following would be tested in integration tests:
- API calls succeed
- File download works
- Delete updates state correctly

### Manual Testing Required
Due to AWS CodeArtifact dependency, manual testing is required:

**Download Excel**:
1. Navigate to HedgeRelationshipDetails page
2. Go to Test Results tab
3. Click "Download Excel" from action dropdown
4. Verify file downloads with correct name
5. Open Excel file and verify data is correct

**Delete Action - Permission Checks**:
1. Test with Draft hedge relationship + regular user → Delete visible
2. Test with Designated hedge relationship + role 24 user → Delete visible
3. Test with Designated hedge relationship + role 17 user → Delete visible
4. Test with Designated hedge relationship + role 5 user → Delete visible
5. Test with Designated hedge relationship + no admin role → Delete hidden

**Delete Action - Functionality**:
1. Click "Delete" from action dropdown
2. Verify confirmation modal appears with correct message
3. Click "Cancel" → Verify modal closes, no deletion
4. Click "Delete" again → Click "Delete" button in modal
5. Verify test batch is removed from grid
6. Verify success toast appears
7. Verify page data is refreshed

**Error Scenarios**:
1. Test with network disconnected → Verify error toast
2. Test with invalid batch ID → Verify error toast
3. Test rapid clicking → Verify no duplicate operations

## Dependencies

### No New Dependencies Added
All functionality uses existing packages and infrastructure:
- MediatR (already in project)
- AutoMapper (already in project)
- Syncfusion components (already in project)
- JSRuntime (already in project)
- IAlertService (already in project)
- IUserAuthData (already in project)

### API Dependencies
- HedgeAccountingApiClient (auto-generated from OpenAPI spec)
- FileType enum (DerivativeEDGEHAEntityEnumFileType)
- API models (DerivativeEDGEHAApiViewModelsHedgeRegressionBatchVM, etc.)

## Migration Compliance

### Business Rules Preserved ✅
1. ✅ Delete requires confirmation
2. ✅ Delete permission based on state and roles
3. ✅ Download always available to all users
4. ✅ Parent state updates after delete
5. ✅ Excel format for downloads

### Legacy Behavior Matched ✅
1. ✅ Same API endpoints used
2. ✅ Same confirmation message
3. ✅ Same permission logic
4. ✅ Same state update pattern
5. ✅ Same user feedback (via toasts)

### Modern Patterns Applied ✅
1. ✅ MediatR CQRS pattern
2. ✅ Async/await throughout
3. ✅ Proper logging
4. ✅ Structured error handling
5. ✅ Component-based UI (not inline JavaScript)

## Potential Improvements (Out of Scope)

The following improvements could be made in future work:
1. Add loading indicators during download/delete operations
2. Add optimistic UI updates (disable button during operation)
3. Add batch delete capability (delete multiple tests)
4. Add download format options (CSV, PDF)
5. Add confirmation for large file downloads
6. Add progress indicator for large file downloads
7. Add audit logging for delete operations
8. Add undo capability after delete

## Known Limitations

1. **No Build Verification**: Cannot build without AWS CodeArtifact credentials
2. **No Automated Tests**: Manual testing required for verification
3. **No Performance Testing**: Large file downloads not tested
4. **No Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader support not verified

## Conclusion

The implementation is **complete and ready for testing**. All business logic has been migrated exactly from the legacy system, following established patterns in the new codebase. The code is well-documented, follows best practices, and maintains compatibility with existing infrastructure.

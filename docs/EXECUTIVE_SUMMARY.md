# Hedge Relationship Migration - Executive Summary

## 📊 Analysis Overview

**Project**: Hedge Accounting System Migration  
**Scope**: Hedge Relationship Details Page  
**Analysis Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Verify that all business rules from the legacy Angular JS hedge relationship system have been properly migrated to the new Blazor Server implementation. This is a **lift-and-shift** migration - no new features, no rule changes, exact behavior replication.

## 🚨 Critical Issues (MUST FIX)

### Issue #1: De-Designate Accrual Calculation
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Impact**: Incorrect financial calculations

**Problem**:
The de-designation workflow requires calculating the accrual value by:
1. Getting the last hedging instrument
2. Fetching its termination date
3. Pricing the instrument at termination
4. Extracting the accrual value

**Current State**: This entire logic is commented out (lines 916-937)

**Business Impact**:
- ❌ Incorrect accrual amounts in de-designation
- ❌ Financial reporting errors
- ❌ Compliance issues
- ❌ Audit trail problems

**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**Complexity**: Moderate (API integration + parsing)

---

## ⚠️ High Priority Items (VERIFY BEFORE RELEASE)

### Issue #2: Analytics Status Check
**Priority**: 🟡 HIGH  
**Status**: 🔍 NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Problem**: Legacy system checks if analytics are ready before allowing re-designation. Not visible in new code.

**Business Impact**: May allow re-designation with stale data.

**Effort**: Small (1 day)

---

### Issue #3: Redraft Amortization Cleanup
**Priority**: 🟡 HIGH  
**Status**: 🔍 NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Problem**: Legacy checks for selected amortization entries and deletes before redrafting. Not implemented in new code.

**Business Impact**: Orphaned amortization data, data integrity issues.

**Effort**: Small (1-2 days)

---

### Issue #4: Designation Workflow Completeness
**Priority**: 🟡 HIGH  
**Status**: 🔍 NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Problem**: Need to verify template checking, keyword validation, and package generation are included in designation command.

**Business Impact**: Missing workflow steps, incomplete documentation.

**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days for verification and fixes)

## 🎓 Business Rules Summary

### Top 10 Critical Rules

1. **Workflow State Machine**
   - Draft → Only Designate
   - Designated → Redraft, De-Designate, Re-Designate (CashFlow only)
   - Dedesignated → Only Redraft

2. **Role-Based Permissions**
   - Roles 24/17/5 required for workflow actions
   - Non-DPI designated users: Read-only
   - SaaS/SwaS contracts: Enhanced permissions

3. **Benchmark Filtering**
   - CashFlow: Exclude 3 specific benchmarks
   - FairValue: Exclude 5 specific benchmarks

4. **Hedge Type Restrictions**
   - NetInvestment NOT for InterestRate risks

5. **Field Dependencies**
   - HedgeRiskType + HedgeType → Auto-reset multiple fields
   - IsAnOptionHedge → Controls 4+ related fields

6. **Validation Gates**
   - Designation: Requires regression batch
   - Preview: Requires regression + permissions
   - Regression: Requires valid benchmark (except FX)

7. **De-Designation Logic**
   - Calculate accrual from last instrument pricing
   - Validate based on reason (Termination vs Ineffectiveness)
   - Conditional basis adjustment fields

8. **Re-Designation Requirements**
   - CashFlow hedges only
   - Analytics must be ready
   - Load conventions from API

9. **Effectiveness Methods**
   - Filtered by HedgeType
   - Further filtered by IsAnOptionHedge
   - Specific exclusions for non-option

10. **Permission-Based Display**
    - 3 permission variables control editability
    - Contract type affects behavior
    - State-dependent field locking

## 🔍 Testing Strategy

### Critical Path Testing
1. **De-Designate Workflow**
   - Create hedge with instrument
   - Price instrument for accrual
   - Verify accrual calculated correctly
   - Complete de-designation
   - Verify all fields saved

2. **Re-Designate Workflow**
   - Designate CashFlow hedge
   - Check analytics status
   - Load re-designation form
   - Verify all conventions loaded
   - Complete re-designation

3. **Redraft Workflow**
   - Create designated hedge
   - Add option amortization
   - Select amortization entry
   - Initiate redraft
   - Verify cleanup occurred

### Regression Testing
- All button disable logic
- All dropdown filtering
- All field auto-reset scenarios
- All permission combinations
- All hedge type + risk type combinations

### UAT Scenarios
- Create new hedge (Draft → Designated)
- Modify designated hedge
- De-designate with termination
- De-designate with ineffectiveness
- Re-designate CashFlow hedge
- Redraft to Draft state
- Verify as different user roles
- Verify with different contract types
